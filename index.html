          Cloud computing refers to a wide range of computing infrastructure services--from storage to software--that
          are delivered over the internet to a customer (normally a company). These services used to be in the scope of
          a company's IT department. But with cloud computing, these services can be handled by a third-party so
          companies can focus on their core business.
        </p>

        <p id="cc-groups">Cloud Computing Services are broken into three main groups:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: This is the lowest level of cloud computing. IaaS provides servers and storage,
              networking and security. Think of it like a company's traditional data center, but completely virtual.
              The customer accesses these services through a user interface. For example. Microsoft Azure or Amazon
              Web Services.
            </li>
            <li>Benefits:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>You can purchase services individually as you need them. This makes IaaS scalable with
                businesses of all sizes</li>
              <li>New services can be deployed in less than a day. When you've decided you need a new
                component of IaaS, you can have it up and running that same day, rather than waiting weeks to set up
                local resources</li>
              <li>Disaster recovery with the cloud is significantly easier than with a traditional data center.
                Your infrastructure "...can be safely and accurately transferred from one data center to a second
                data center without the burden of reloading each component of the server. This can dramatically
                reduce recovery times compared to conventional (non-virtualized) disaster recovery approaches..."

                  (Online Tech)
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: This is the mid-tier of cloud computing. Along with all IaaS components, PaaS offers a
              suite of services to support a web application's entire lifecycle including development tools, database
              management, and business analytics.</li>
            <li>Benefits:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All the benefits of IaaS plus...</li>
              <li>Reduces coding time. PaaS tools come with "pre-coded application components built into the
                platform, such as workflow, directory services, security features, search, and so on."
                <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-paas/">(Microsoft - What is PaaS?)</a>
              </li>
              <li>Since the development environment is virtual, you and your team can work on your application remotely</li>
              <li>All the tools you need to develop and manage a web app are included in PaaS</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Description: This is the most holistic version of cloud computing and also the most common. In
              addition to the services described in IaaS and PaaS, SaaS provides hosted applications, such as
              email, calendars, and customer Relationship Management (CRM).</li>
            <li>Benefits:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All the benefits of IaaS and PaaS plus...</li>
              <li>Most applications can be run from the web, making your work accessible anywhere with an
                internet connection</li>
              <li>The customer isn't responsible for updating the software</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When it comes to asking "which type of cloud computing is right for me?", what you should really ask
          yourself is, "how much of your company's IT do you want controlled by a third-party vendor?" This graphic
          from Stephen Watts of <i>bmc blog</i> breaks down your options:
        </p>

        <p>
          If your needs are purely IT infrastructure based, go with an IaaS provider like Microsoft Azure or Digital
          Ocean. If you're concerned with building and deploying web apps quickly, without having to worry about
          software updates, look into PaaS providers like Heroku or Apache Stratos. If you want your company to deal
          with as little IT as possible, SaaS is right for you. Some examples of SaaS providers are Salesforce
          (CRM), and Concur (Travel/Expense management).
